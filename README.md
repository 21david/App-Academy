# App Academy
Welcome! This repository contains all of my work from the [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/) Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp.

**App Academy** is an intensive, project-based bootcamp covering modern web development, problem-solving, and real-world engineering practices through hands-on learning, collaboration, and building production-quality web applications. Hereâ€™s what I studied and practiced:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, React (intro), SQL, HTML, CSS, Sass/SCSS
- **Testing:** RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, unit and integration testing
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL exercises
- **Front-end:** React components, Webpack, Babel, CSS/SCSS
- **Back-end:** MVC architecture, RESTful APIs, authentication, session management
- **Development Tools:** Git & GitHub, VS Code Chrome DevTools, Bundler, Spring, Byebug, Pry, Puma

Throughout the bootcamp, we focused on: 
- Daily pair programming and code reviews with rotating diverse peers
- Heavy emphasis on test-driven development and clean code
- Best software engineering practices such as decoupling (writing modular, maintainable code)
- Detailed lectures on new concepts and daily homework to reinforce concepts
- Effective debugging strategies
- Project requirements gathering and documentation
- Agile development and industry workflows

## Project
I worked on [Amongst Us](https://github.com/21david/Amongst-Us), a clone of the popular game Among Us, over the course of one week, using JavaScript (canvas), HTML, CSS, and a simulated Agile workflow in a team where each person worked on their own project.
